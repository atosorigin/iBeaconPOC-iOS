#iBeacon iOS App Example
This project is a simple demonstrator of using iBeacons within iOS apps. There are two apps in this project. The broadcaster app needs to be run and kept in the foreground on any compatible iOS device. The receiver app will then be able to scan for the beacon.

The receiver app has a basic floorplan of an office. The floorplan will highlight where it has determined the beacon to be. This is determined by the advertised maxValue from the broadcaster (which is the POC demo is configurable from the main screen).
